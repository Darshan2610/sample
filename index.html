            <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
            <p>Developing an adaptive learning path feature that customizes the sequence of educational content and exercises based on each student's performance and progress. The feature dynamically adjusts to provide more practice on weaker areas and introduces new topics as the student improves.</p>

            <h2>Explanation of Design Choices</h2>
            <h3>Database Schema:</h3>
            <p>The Students Table stores basic student information and their current learning level. The Content Table contains educational content and the level it is associated with. The Performance Table records each student’s performance, allowing us to track progress and identify weaker areas. The Progress Table tracks the status of content completion for each student, ensuring the system knows what content has been attempted.</p>
            <h3>API Endpoints:</h3>
            <p>The API layer provides necessary endpoints to fetch student data, retrieve the next piece of content, record performance, and update progress. These endpoints help in deciding the next content, recording how well a student performed, fetching progress details, and updating the progress status.</p>
            <h3>Front-end Components:</h3>
            <p>The Dashboard Component provides an overview of the student's progress and performance, helping them understand their learning journey. The Content Viewer Component displays the educational content and exercises, forming the core interaction point for students. The Performance Tracker Component allows students to see their past performance and receive feedback, encouraging self-assessment and improvement.</p>
